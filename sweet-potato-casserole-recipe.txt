“Sweet Potato Casserole” (a.k.a. “Pat’s Mom’s Sweet Potatoes”)
I have served this casserole for several years at Thanksgiving and will likely continue as long as I am able, as no one will allow me to change the menu. Double the recipe for a large group.
Boil sweet potatoes until they are easily speared with a fork (estimate 1 large potato per cup for recipe).
Melt 2/3 cup of butter and divide it.
Mix together the following:
3 cups cooked, mashed sweet potatoes
1 cup sugar
2 eggs
1/2 cup evaporated milk (like Carnation or Pet)
1 tbs.vanilla
1/3 cup melted butter
Pour this mixture into a 2 quart casserole dish and then mix the following:
1/3 cup butter
1 cup shredded coconut (I use the frozen kind)
1 cup pecans
1 cup light brown sugar (packed)
1/3 cup flour
Spread this mixture over the first and bake at 350 degrees for 30-45 minutes.
